					<h3>Extreme Storms and Floods</h3>
					<p>
						<label for="B">B</label>
    					ecause the sun’s temperature has become uncontrollable, glaciers and ice polar have started to melt, which ultimately cause the rise of sea levels all around the globe. Scientists forecast that if global warming will continue for the next decades, it will not be impossible that seas, oceans, and rivers would be 20 feet higher in 2100. Ultimately, it means more flash floods in the years to come given that ¾ of our planet is actually composed of water. Speaking of flash floods, Alberta faced its worst record of flash flood in its history in June 2013 as hundreds and thousands of people have been evacuated. Experts say that the hasty and unpredictable hydrological cycle in the area caused by global warming had caused the intense flood. The Far East has also experienced one of the worst flood scenarios in its history when the Amur Region experienced one of the highest floods in its record in August 2013. Non-stop raining in July and August raised the water to about 15 centimeters higher than its usual record. The said detail is apparently away from its usual record, which was only a mere 6 centimeters for the past decades. In 2010, Pakistan was dubbed to be the first country to experience the worst flash floods of its history, leaving 20 million Pakistanis homeless. The government of Pakistan, along with environmental ecologists, blamed greenhouse emitting countries for such occurrence. Pakistan only has 0.4 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while other countries reach as far as 10% for carbon footprint in its manufacturing plants.Click here for more <a class="alink" href="http://www.stormsurge.noaa.gov/overview_causes.html"target="_blank"> Info</a>

				<h3>Melting Glaciers</h3>
				<p>
						<label for="A">A</label>
						s mentioned above, rising sea levels is predominantly caused by the constant melting of glaciers and polar ice caps in arctic territories. However, the melting of these glaciers can’t only cause the increase of sea levels, but also cause a reduction to the water flow of the Gulf Stream. The said effect can create imbalance in the climate of some countries in the affected area including those in Europe, Greenland, and North America. Once this happens, shipment of gas and oil would be put at stake in the arctic territories, which could affect the supply of such resources to the countries that depend on them. Apart from that, it also results to drastic climate change in which summer becomes hotter and winter becomes colder. Others may also experience warm temperatures in winter and cold temperatures in summer. In addition to that, stronger hurricanes can occur given that it is sensitive to the sea’s changing temperature.Click here for more <a class="alink" href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/"target="_blank"> Info</a>

				<h3>Heat Waves</h3>
				<p>
						<label for="T">T</label>
						he thinning of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the sun’s intense heat is tremendous and it has apparently caused increase of the Earth’s temperature that is capable of creating heat waves to affected countries. Few years ago, several elderly people in the Philippines and Australia were sent to the hospital because of heat stroke. In July this year, Britain experienced one of the hottest seasons in its history with Mercury reaching to as high as 35C since the summer of 2006. Tons of people went to the coast to sunbathe while others went to the hospital due to heat stroke. Some children were also sent to the hospital due to sunburn. Fishes were trapped in drying pools of water while some children and graduates positioned themselves in public fountains to cool off. Meanwhile, recorded blazes rounded off to 27 in a span of 6 days. In England, at least 760 people died during the July heat wave in UK. The main causes of death include loss of breathing, heart attack, and extreme sunburns. Last May, at least three people were dead in New Delhi due to heat wave. Its temperatures went down to as low as 47 degrees Celsius with other places in the country experiencing as low as 44 degrees Celsius.Click here for more <a class="alink" href="https://www.climatecommunication.org/new/features/heat-waves-and-climate-change/heat-waves-the-details/"target="_blank"> Info</a>
